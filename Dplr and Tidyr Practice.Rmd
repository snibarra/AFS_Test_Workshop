```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```

##Making a pipe to filter data easier
```{r}
catch_df %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>% 
  head()
```

##Keeping only columns that we care about!! This is a powerful approach! 
```{r}
catch_df <-catch_df%>%
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)
head(catch_df)
```


##Keeping only columns that we care about!! You can do this in another way by selecting all except, blah blah
